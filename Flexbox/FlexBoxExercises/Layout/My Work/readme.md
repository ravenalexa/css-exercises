The objective of this exercise was to create a simple layout page.
My solution looks correct in the browser, but as a developer I believe
my solution was not the most effective.

The solution provided did not adjust height, did a better job of grouping CSS styles,
and perfected margin and padding.

I am still working to achieve my goals in a more simple and efficient fashion.

Though my approach to creating the layout was not ideal, I did add a few cool features.

I added a placeholder for the search bar, a cursor for the buttons, as well as hover and transition.

I plan to try this project with a new approach after further study.
